# React Animations
In React, we can add animation using an explicit group of components known as the React Transition Group.
React Transition Group is an add-on component for managing component states and useful for defining entering and exiting transitions. 
React Transition group has mainly two APIs to create transitions.

# Installation
` npm install react-transition-group --save `

React Transition Group API provides three main components. These are:

1. Transition
2. CSSTransition
3. Transition Group

# Transition

It has a simple component API to describe a transition from one component state to another over time. It is mainly used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component. It can also be used for in-place transition states as well.
We can access the Transition component into four states:

1. entering
2. entered
3. exiting
4. exited

# CSSTransition
