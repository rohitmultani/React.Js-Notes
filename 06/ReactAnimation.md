# React Animations
In React, we can add animation using an explicit group of components known as the React Transition Group.
React Transition Group is an add-on component for managing component states and useful for defining entering and exiting transitions. 
React Transition group has mainly two APIs to create transitions.

# Installation
` npm install react-transition-group --save `
