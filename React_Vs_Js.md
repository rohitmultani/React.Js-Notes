|----------  |:-------------:|
| Plain JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML) |  React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript. | 
| plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit. |   React requires you to break your UI into components |  
| Data for plain JS apps are stored in the DOM itself and has to be found from the DOM before it can be used.|  React apps store data in regular JavaScript variables |  
| UI updates in plain JS have to happen by finding the DOM node to update and manually appending or removing elements |  React automatically updates the UI based on setting and changing state within the component.|
