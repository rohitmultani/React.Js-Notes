# React Hooks

Hooks are simply functions that allow you to hook into or make use of React features. 
Before React 16.8, class-based components were mandatory for any projects that require states, life-cycle methods, and many other important functionalities.React class-based components are messy, confusing, hard for humans and machines.

## Hooks can be classified as
- Built-In React hooks (which we need to import from 'react')
- Custom Hooks (User Defined Hooks)
